##How to run it

Each module has its own dependencies. If you want to run any of them on your local machine, follow the steps below:

- Module 1 : Run npx parcel <folder>/index.html with the file you are interested in from index.html. For example: npx parcel Ejercicio-01/index. html

- Module 2 : Install the dependencies in the corresponding folder and run npm run start
